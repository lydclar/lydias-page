    <h1>Lydia Clark</h1>
    <p>
        Hello everyone, and welcome to my page! My name is Lydia Clark. I am from Shreveport, Louisiana, and I am a Computer Science major and Art Practices minor at the University of Colorado Boulder, set to graduate and earn my bachelors degree in December of 2025. My background blends technical expertise with creative problem-solving, making me a versatile and innovative thinker.
        For the past year, I’ve been working as an intern at a small full-stack web development startup based out of Littleton, Colorado, called Nvok, where I’ve worked alongside 5 other developers to help build websites using a variety of frontend and backend frameworks and tools. So far, I have developed strong skills in C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Linux, and Nessus, but I’m also drawn to areas like machine learning, networks, cybersecurity, and AI, which I am just beginning to learn more about in my free time. I love finding ways to solve complex problems, and I believe my background in art enhances my ability to think outside the box in order to find creative solutions.
        I’ve also gained leadership and teamwork experience from my time working at Ben & Jerry’s, where I worked as a shift manager, catering manager, and social media manager. In addition to customer service and team coordination, these roles helped to strengthen my ability to work well under pressure in fast-paced environments as well as my ability to adapt to new roles in the workplace.
        I enjoy collaborating with others on teams, always maintaining a positive attitude at work, and as a curious person I love to continue to expand my knowledge, and I am really excited to find a career path that aligns with my skills and interests.
